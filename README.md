# What is this project ?

This is a form/quiz application in which user can create questions of different types like Multiple Choice Questions, Fill Blanks Question or True False Question.

# What inspired me to create this application ?

I have participated in TypeForm and Google Forms surveys, while TypeForm has a lot of flexibility, it also comes with a price, many in low-priviledged areas would consider it
expensive to be used at all. So this was the biggest factor, and I plan to share it free with some teachers initially to get their feedback.

Secondly, I wanted to gain exposure by working on a web application as I thought it would offer me termendous learning opportunies, like managing authentications, and databases.
I am enjoying working on it as this presents challenges on every step to solve and evolve.
